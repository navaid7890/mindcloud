                    <p>Nobody knows your business better than you do. However, bringing your vision and aspirations for your startup to fruition can be a rocky path. Getting a hands-on advisor can materially improve the way your company operates and achieve your goals quicker by leveraging the experience of professionals who have walked the same path. The advisor can think about all aspects of your business and provide an external point of view essential to founders who often deep dive into specific tasks and sometimes miss the big picture. The advisor will provide proper advice, useful intros, help you develop an investment plan, give you social proof and monitor you decision making process. In a nutshell, set your business on the right course.</p>

                    <p>Designed by Mind Cloud Academy and Advisors Genny-Ghanimeh and Marwan Salem, the advisory process covers the core components of an effective success roadmap for your startup or business.</p>
